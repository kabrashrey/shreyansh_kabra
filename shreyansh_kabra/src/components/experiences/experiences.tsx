      "At HPE, I worked as a Cloud Developer, building APIs using Python, Django, and DRF for invoice management and contracts onboarding portals that integrated PostgreSQL and ServiceNow. I automated data workflows with Apache Airflow, built end-to-end API and UI components for a web-based notification system that improved communication efficiency by 80%, and contributed to the HPE GreenLake NaaS platform with cross-module REST API integrations. I also developed dynamic ITSM forms, reducing submission errors by over 50%, led mentoring sessions for junior developers, and collaborated with over 10 international cross-functional teams to ensure timely project delivery.",

      "During my internship at HPE in the NaaS team, I developed a Python package with async capabilities to automate switch and IAP configuration, eliminating 90% of manual setup time. I enhanced the troubleshooting workflow by reducing manual effort by 70% and improved execution speed through asynchronous patterns. I also created REST APIs to integrate ServiceNow with internal tooling, improving data exchange and operational efficiency by over 50%.",
